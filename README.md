# airport-dropdown-solution
Implement a React component "AirportChooser" which is a button used to select one of many airports.  The button when clicked should show a dropdown with list of all available airports.  Each airport should display its name, city/country, and airport code.  Display a loading state in case list of airports is not ready initially.  Ensure the component can effectively support a large number of airports (40,000+).  Include CSS styles for the component as well as a usage example.  Do not use any 3rd party components for this project, only React itself.  The actual list of airports should not be hardcoded in the component, but uploaded from a file.  This list of airports may be useful for testing: https://gist.github.com/tdreyno/4278655
